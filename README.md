# RobotLab-Follow-a-line-with-Closed-Loop-Feedback

Within a work space and starting at a marked location (a red perpendicular line), the Turtlebot is required to navigate an arcdoor path and stop on the ending point that is marked.
Your robot must announce the start of its journey by beeping three times.
When your robot completes this task, and stops at the finish line, it must play the song three blind mice” to declare its ”mission completed”.
There will be a tape on the floor to guide the robot. Your robot must use its onboard Kinect sensor to perform this task. No modification, no change of position of the kinect sensor is allowed. The entire task must be completed within reasonable time duration, say around 3–5 minutes.
The performance of your final DEMO will be based on quality of tracking the path as determined by the marker.
